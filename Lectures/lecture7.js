/* 
I. Web and Mobile Technology Stack
    a. front-end
    b. back-end
    c. data-base

II. Reactive Native
    a. creating a user interface
    b. adding functions and ddata control
    c. Using Expo
    d. Creating your first .apk file



* Visualization and GUI Progamming

Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)
- system of interacctive visual components for computer software
- objects that convey information and represent actions
- combination of different parts na pinagsasama 

USe Cases
- sliders
- button
- panels
- carousels
- hyperlink

Web and Mobile Texhnologies stack
- same concept (front end, back end, database)

Full stack development: similar to pass the message
Data base -> server/backend -> front end
backend (database and server)

Waiter - front end
Server - chef
Data base - supplier

Front end
- what users see and what they interact with
- composed of the User interface to give the used a better user experience (UIUX programmer)
A and B testing (two versions - which is more engaging)
- GUI elements and basic codes to send the data to and from the server
- makes it pretty basic codes
eg. HTML

Back End
- does the dirty work
- more of processing
- how to provide data needed by the user
- sorting, filtering, processing
- optimizations of current processes and workflows
- routes

Database
- stores all the data
- stores and organizes all information
- can perform basic queries (excel sheet filtering)
- storing and sercurity
- security of data
SQL (structured query language ) - seperrated in rows and columns
eg. MySQL, Microsoft Azure, Aurora

* React Native
- and open-source UI software framework created by Meta Platforms 
- use to create native applications for Android, IOS, Web Windows, etc
(cross platform - pwede in different platforms)
- ReactJS general term
- uses java script
Advantages: cost effective and efficient

Expo
- makes it even easier
- built on top of reactive native 
- remove the compplicated parts of mobile app development 

Basic GUI Elements
Component 
- building block of creating UI
- Reusable piece of code that encapsulates a specific functionalit of UI element (similar to a function)
- has start and end tag just lik HTML
- can have properties which describe how a component appears of functions
View
- the most fundamental component for building UI
- Basically a Box
- container of other components
- container that supports layout of flexbox, style...
Text
- label
- display information/text
- static or dynamic
- nesting, styling, and touch handling
TextInput
- inputing text into the keyboard
