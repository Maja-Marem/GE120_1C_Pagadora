1. Procedural Programming - Object-Oriented Programming
Procedural programming is a sequencial type of programming, meaning it is a step by step program that follows a certain order
while Object-Oriented Programming uses classes to create a blueprint for object so that it there is no need to repeat certain steps to follow a step by step ordered programing

Procedural - may pagkakasunoddunod ung prgramming, so parang like if need ule sa ibang part ung na code mo na previously i rerewrite mo sya for that part
OOP - pwede ka gumamit ng class para if may similarity ung code in different parts di mo na need isulat/type ung buong code for it and use insted ung class(blueprint)

2. GUI - Global User Interface 
This are the features interacting to create and app, a system of interacctive visual components for computer software
this are the objects that convey information and represent actions, a combination of different parts na pinagsasama 
Basically GUI simplifies the app development process by elimiting ung hardcore parts and application programming.

In the fied naman of Geomatics applications, similar sa fact na app ung naisip ng group namin na project. GUI allows us na students to create/generate Geomatic related application
with reduced hassle

3. Operation Overloading ing OOP
Basically including ung different functions such as calculations and such. Like combining attriutes and methods in a class that uses certain 
(commands? - not so sure sa term pero like ung && + = etc.)

4. Discuss the Concept of Inheritance of Object-oriented Programming
Inheritance - dito papasok ung Superclass and Subclass
basically Parent class and ung anak na class
ung anak na Class or Subclass is a branch na class from super class or the parent class
if titingnan from a puno perspective ung trunk ung parent class then nag brabranch sya sa subclasses, then as u go further up the tree mas nagiging fine ung branches similarly
as nag inintorduce na ng subclasses mas nagiging specific ung class nayon.

eg. 
Person - AcademicPerson - STEM
Person - AthleticPerson - BBALL

5. Frontend - Backend - DataBase
Analogy: In a library
Frontend - the front end is basically ung areas with books or from which you can access the books 
(what the users see)
Backend - basically ung responsible to managing mainting those books and informations about the books ung librarians 
(the one that does the dirty work, more of processing)
Database -  ung nagstostore ng information about the different books na meron and where you can access them specifically, so like the Card Catalog of all the books na andun 
(stores and organizzes the data)
